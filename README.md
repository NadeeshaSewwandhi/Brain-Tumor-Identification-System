# Brain-Tumor-Identification-System

The system is designed to assist medical professionals in detecting and classifying brain tumors from medical imaging data, such as MRI scans.

This Brain Tumor Identification System includes image preprocessing techniques for enhancing MRI image quality, algorithms for isolating brain regions and identifying potential tumor areas, feature extraction from segmented tumor regions, machine learning models for classifying tumor type and severity, and tools for visualizing the segmentation and classification results on the original MRI images.

The system leverages Python for implementing image processing and machine learning algorithms, OpenCV for tasks such as filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction, scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models, TensorFlow/Keras for developing deep learning models for tumor classification, and Matplotlib for visualizing the results of image processing and classification.
