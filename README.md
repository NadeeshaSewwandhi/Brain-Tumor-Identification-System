# Brain-Tumor-Identification-System

The system is designed to assist medical professionals in detecting and classifying brain tumors from medical imaging data, such as MRI scans.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Techniques for enhancing the quality of MRI images, including noise reduction and normalization.
Segmentation: Algorithms for isolating the brain region and identifying potential tumor areas.
Feature Extraction: Extraction of critical features from the segmented tumor regions for further analysis.
Classification: Machine learning models trained to classify the type and severity of the detected tumors.
Visualization: Tools for visualizing the segmentation and classification results on the original MRI images.

Technologies Used
Python: For implementing the image processing and machine learning algorithms.
OpenCV: For image processing tasks such as filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
TensorFlow/Keras: For developing deep learning models for tumor classification.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the results of the image processing and classification.
